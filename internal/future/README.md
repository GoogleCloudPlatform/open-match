In Open Match 0.6.0 we'll be making large changes to the project to improve testability and stability in the future.

A lot of these pieces are restructured versions of modules in the internal/ directory. To avoid confusion between old and new versions, the new version of the stack will be within this directory structure while keeping the old code around for scaffolding purposes. Eventually the new modules will replace the old ones once they are ready to.
